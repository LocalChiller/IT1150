                    Slugate was founded in 1905 by Cornelius Dunkehnfrondt as a mining town after he discovered a new metal, which he named after himself, Dunkehnfronzite. This metal was stronger than any previously discovered material and was abundant in the region, ensuring Slugate would have a steady supply for generations.

                    The magical energies of Dunkehnfronzite were discovered accidentally when Cornelius Dunkehnfrondt, then mayor of Slugate, accidentally spilled a solution of unknown contents in a container full of the refined metal. What exactly happened afterward is disputed, though most witnesses confirm that there was an inexplicable explosion in city hall accompanied by green flames and ominous chanting. After this event Cornelius dedicated a portion of his vast wealth to the research of the magical arts, cementing Slugate as the greatest center for magical knowledge in the world.

                    After gaining independence, Slugate constructed the Chaos Mage Guild, directly across from the new city hall building. Those critical of magical practices believed that city officials were influenced by rogue mages, but the city denied these allegations. Any detractors of the Chaos Mage Guild would later be forced out of the city during a 'mass cleansing ritual', which the senior mages performed 'to keep the energy of Slugate strong'.

                    Governments across the world declare Slugate a rogue state and began a war with the city. With the Chaos Mage Guild having been established for several decades at this point, most of the citizens of Slugate were well-versed in the practice of magic. Despite their small size, this greatly tipped the balance in Slugate's favor. The war only lasted a few months, ending when mages from outside of Slugate attempted to destroy the barrier protecting the city. Not understanding how the magic worked, their plan failed and caused a shockwave to emanate from the city, destroying everything in a massive area outside the city.

                    During the celebration of the anniversary of the Great War's ending, Cornelius Dunkehnfrondt, kept young by his knowledge of Dunkehnfronzite magic, accidentally detonated a large cache of refined Dunkehnfronzite. The resulting explosion was so powerful that it destroyed the Chaos Mage Guild and much of the city's buildings and infrastructure. With the destruction of the Chaos Mage Guild Slugate also lost most of the magical knowledge that was stored in its library. With the loss of the knowledge that powered it, the barrier surrounding the city shattered. Now Slugate is open to all outside forces and lacks any kind of magical presence, although some believe the Chaos Mages will rebuild in the future.
