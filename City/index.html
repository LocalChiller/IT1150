                    Slugate is home to 400,000 people of all backgrounds. New citizens and tourists are drawn in by our world-class restaurants, entertainment centers, and infrastructure. We pride ourselves on having the cleanest streets packed with the friendliest people in the country. This is made possible thanks to the destruction of all other population centers on the continent after the Great War, which left billions outside of our borders without functioning governments. After witnessing our barely working society you'll never want to leave!
