            <h1>Ruins of the Guild</h1>
            
            <p>
                See the destroyed Chaos Mage guild where practicers of the dark arts performed unknown rituals which eventually lead to the destruction of modern society. The building should only be viewed from outside, at least 500 feet away from its outer walls. Venturing inside the ruined halls of the Guild is highly inadvisable as the ghosts of mages long dead are believed to linger there, ceaselessly tormenting any who enter.

            <h1>Remains of the Commercial District</h1>
            
            <p>
                Witness what was once the commercial district of Slugate, now destroyed beyond recognition. Containers filled with relics of a bygone era, rendered useless by the immense energies released after the Great War.

            <h1>Last Vestiges of Old Slugate</h1>
            
            <p>
                Take in the astounding sight of the last remaining structures of Old Slugate. These buildings were resilient enough to survive the explosion that destroyed the city, although any community that existed here has long since left to rebuild somewhere with fewer bad memories.
