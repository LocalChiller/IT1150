        <p>
            My name is Anthony, but I prefer to go by Tony. I have some experience with web development but I hope to reinforce my current knowledge and learn something new this semester. I am not sure what I will do after graduating, but I am not opposed to working towards a bachelors degree. After finishing my degree I would like to become a software developer.
